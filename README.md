# Dogs_vs_Cats

Implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using Keras to predict images of dogs and cats.


TODO:
* Research about optimizers and learning rate schudeling to improve the validation accuracy of the model
* Add some kind of plot to help understand the problem and try new solutions.
